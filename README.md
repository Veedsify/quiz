   ```

### Database

The SQLite database (`quiz.db`) is automatically created in the project root when the first response is submitted. No additional setup required.

## üìä Database Schema

The application uses a single table structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE quiz_responses (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  accessors_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  accessors_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  responses TEXT NOT NULL,        -- JSON string of all responses
  total_score INTEGER NOT NULL,
  section_scores TEXT NOT NULL,   -- JSON string of section scores
  completed_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)
```

## üé® Customization

### Styling

The app uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Key design elements:

- **Color Scheme**: Blue/Indigo gradient theme
- **Typography**: Geist font family
- **Animations**: Framer Motion transitions
- **Layout**: Responsive grid and flexbox layouts

### Quiz Content

To modify quiz questions or scoring:
